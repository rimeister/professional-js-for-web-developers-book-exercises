			<h1>Chapter 4: Variables, Scope, and Memory</h1>
			<div>
				<h2>Primitive and Reference Values</h2>				
				<p>As the title suggests, there are two types of values a variable can hold: primitive values and reference values.</p>

				<p>Primitive values are "atomic" pieces of data, like numbers and strings. When a primitive value is assigned to a variable, a copy of that value is assigned to the variable.</p>

				<p>A reference value points to an object (it references it), so no values are copied/duplicated when an object is assigned to a new variable. If a reference value is copied into a new variable, and then one of the properties of the new variable are modified, any other variables which reference this object will also reflect this change.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Argument Passing</h2>
				<p>All arguments are passed into a function by value, not by reference. So, if you try to update an object that was passed into a function as an argument (such as changing obj.name, in the example below), it does not change the object that was passed in, it only changes the local object created inside the function. The local object is destroyed as soon as the function has finished executing. Huh, this is actually still confusing, because <em>obj</em> inside the function still references the original object, until they try to overwrite it by declaring it as a new object. It says it is copied into <em>obj</em>, but that obj and <em>person</em> both point to the same object. Using <em>new</em> makes <em>obj</em> point to a different object, an object which is destroyed after the function runs. So, what would the alternative be? What would a reference argument be? Don't know, might need to look it up.</p><br>

				<p>Here's an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/373419/whats-the-difference-between-passing-by-reference-vs-passing-by-value">up-voted answer from Stack Overflow:</a></p>

				<p><strong>"When a parameter is passed by reference, the caller and the callee use the same variable for the parameter. If the callee modifies the parameter variable, the effect is visible to the caller's variable.<br><br>
				When a parameter is passed by value, the caller and callee have two independent variables with the same value. If the callee modifies the parameter variable, the effect is not visible to the caller."</strong></p>
				<br>
				<p>Okay, so, two indpendent variables. Changing what the local variable points to in the function doesn't change what the original variable points to. Think I got it.</p><br>
				<h4>Code</h4>
				<code>
					&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function setName(obj) {<br>
					    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.name = "Nicholas";<br>
					    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj = new Object;<br>
					    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.name = "Greg";<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var person = new Object();<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setName(person);<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert(person.name);<br><br>
					&lt;/script&gt;<br>
				</code>

				<h4>Working Example:</h4>
				<script type="text/javascript">
					function setName(obj) {
					    obj.name = "Nicholas";
					    obj = new Object;
					    obj.name = "Greg";
					}

					var person = new Object();
					setName(person);
				</script>

				<a href="#" onClick="event.preventDefault();alert(person.name);">Click here to see what the value of <em>person.name</em> is.</a> It is, indeed, "Nicholas" and not "Greg".
			</div>
			<br>

			<div>
				<h2>Determining Type</h2>
				<p>The <em>typeof</em> works well with primitive values, but doesn't work well with reference types, since it will only tell you it's an object. For reference types, you want to use <em>instanceof</em> operator, which can tell you which type of object it is. Note, any reference type will always be an instance of Object.</p>
				<h4>Code</h4>
				<code>
					&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br>
					

					var person = new Object();<br>
					var arr = new Array();<br>
					
					alert(person instanceof Object);
					alert(arr instanceof Array);

					&lt;/script&gt;<br>
				</code>

				<h4>Working Example:</h4>
				<script type="text/javascript">

					var person = new Object();
					var arr = new Array();
					
				</script>

				<a href="#" onClick="event.preventDefault();alert(person instanceof Object);">Click here to see if <em>person</em> is an instance of Object.</a><br>

				<a href="#" onClick="event.preventDefault();alert(person instanceof Object);">Click here to see if <em>arr</em> is an instance of Array.</a>

			</div>
			<br>

			<div>
				<h2>Execution Context and Scope</h2>
				<p><em>Context</em> refers to the code block in which something happens. The <em>scope chain</em> refers to the hierarchy of variables that a particular context has access to.</p>
				<p>The <em>global</em> scope, also referred to as the <em>window</em>, is the outermost context, and is available to any other execution context. <del>An execution context could be a function, a for loop, or any block of code that terminates.</del> In javascript, there are only two primary types of execution contexts: global and function. So, a code block such as as <em>if</em> statement or a <em>for</em> loop does not have its own scope, and variables declared within it will be added to the global context. Below, I have created variables in three execution contexts:</p>
				<h4>Code</h4>
				<code>
					&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br>
					
					<br>
					var levelOne = 1;<br>
					<br>
					function secondLevel() {<br>
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var levelTwo = 2;<br>
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function thirdLevel(){<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var levelThree = 3;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
					<br>
					}<br>
					<br>
					&lt;/script&gt;<br>
				</code>
				<br><br>
				<p>By clicking the links below, you can see that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The global context has access to the variable declared within it (var <em>levelOne</em>).</li>
					<li>The function <em>secondLevel()</em> has access to the levelOne variable (in the global context), and the <em>levelTwo</em> variable declared within the secondLevel() function.</li>
					<li>The <em>thirdLevel()</em> function, which is nested in the levelTwo() function, has access to the levelOne var, the levelTwo var, and the levelThree var declared inside thirdLevel().</li>
				</ol><br>

				<h4>Working Example:</h4>

				<a href="#" onClick="event.preventDefault();firstLevel();">1. Click here to run the <em>firstLevel()</em> function.</a><br>

				<a href="#" onClick="event.preventDefault();secondLevel(event);">2. Click here to run the <em>secondLevel()</em> function.</a><br>

				<a href="#" id="level-three-btn">3. Click here to run the <em>thirdLevel()</em> function.</a>

				<script type="text/javascript">


					var levelOne = 1;

					// I run the secondLevel function here in order to add an eventlistener to the third button. I had to add the event listener inside the secondLevel function ir order to have access to the levelThree function contained within the levelTwo function. But, the level two function needs to run in order to bind that click event to the third button. So, that's why I run it here. Maybe there is a better way to do this, and I will learn it soon.
					secondLevel();

					function firstLevel() {
						alert(levelOne);
						if (typeof levelTwo !== "undefined") {	
							alert(levelTwo);
						} else {
							alert("\"levelTwo\" is undefined")
						}

						if (typeof levelThree !== "undefined") {
							alert(levelThree);
						} else {	
							alert("\"levelThree\" is undefined");
						}

					}

					function secondLevel(event) {

						var levelTwo = 2;
						// Only run this if the function is called from a click even (i.e., the second button is clicked). I needed to put this here in order to prevent the alerts from firing when I run the function above in the global context.
						if (event && event.type === 'click') {

							alert(levelOne);

							if (typeof levelTwo !== "undefined") {	
								alert(levelTwo);
							} else {
								alert("\"levelTwo\" is undefined")
							}

							if (typeof levelThree !== "undefined") {
								alert(levelThree);
							} else {	
								alert("\"levelThree\" is undefined");
							}

						}

						function thirdLevel(){

							var levelThree = 3;

							alert(levelOne);

							if (typeof levelTwo !== "undefined") {	
								alert(levelTwo);
							} else {
								alert("\"levelTwo\" is undefined")
							}

							if (typeof levelThree !== "undefined") {
								alert(levelThree);
							} else {	
								alert("\"levelThree\" is undefined");
							}

						}

						document.getElementById('level-three-btn').addEventListener('click', function(event){
							event.preventDefault();
						    thirdLevel();
						});

					}

				<h2>Scope Chain Augmentation</h2>
				<p>This section discusses two methods of <em>augmenting</em> the scope chain: <em>try-catch</em> and <em>with</em>. To be honest, reading the explanation isn't enhhancing my understanding of what Scope Chain Augmentation is. I will have to also Google this one.</p>
				<p>Did a little Googling to find out what a <em>try/catch</em> statement is. I actually watched a video in the <em>C</em> programming language. As I learned earlier today from the Lynda course <em>Programming Foundations Fundamentals</em>, javascript is a language evolved from C, and is a C-style language (using curly braces and semicolons at the end of code blocks).</p>
				<p>A <em>try/catch</em> statement is intended to catch exceptions (i.e., errors), then do something if they encounter errors in the <em>try</em> statement. I guess I originally thought that the author meant that a try/catch statement was a way of augmenting the scope chain (as in, you could purposely use it to access variables that are out of scope), but now I see it is intended for catching errors, and maybe just has to augment the scope chain somehow in order to do that. Also, I see from some diagrams on the web, that the scope chain appears to be "zero-based", meaning that the first item is numbered 0. So, if you have a function, it's position in the scope chain (of that context) would be 0, and the global/window would be 1. This is demonstrated in this image I found online:</p>
				<img src="writing-efficient-javascript-24-728.jpg"><br><br>
				<p>So, it might be the case that it adds something else at position 0, which I think would be the front of the scope chain. I guess the same goes for the <em>with</em> statement.</p>
				<p>Here's the <em>with</em> statement demo. I am not totally sure how the scope chain is being augmented here, though the book says "For the <em>with</em> statement, the specified object is added to the scope chain." (p. 93). "In this example, the <em>with</em> statement is acting on the location object, so <em>location</em> itself is added to the front of the scope chain." So... <em>location</em> is in position 0 in the scope chain?</p>
				<p>The author seems to have also written a book called "Writing Efficient Javascript," in which he talks about this as well. Here is an image from <a href="http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/server-administration/excerpts/even-faster-websites/writing-efficient-javascript.html">the web page for that book</a> demonstrating scope chain:</p>
				<img src="I_mediaobject7_d1e7080-web.png"><br><br>
				<p>Here is a quote from that page explaining the diagram:</p>
				<p><strong>"The scope chain for a given execution context typically remains unchanged during code execution. There are, however, two statements that temporarily augment the scope chain of an execution context. The first is the with statement, which is designed to allow easy access to object properties by making them appear as local variables. For example:"</strong><br>	
				<br>
				<em>	
				var person = {<br>	
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: "Nicholas",<br>	
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age: 30<br>	
				};<br>	
				<br>	
				function displayInfo(){<br>	
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var count = 5;<br>	
				&nbsp;&nbsp;with(person){<br>	
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert(name + " is " + age);<br>	
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("Count is " + count);<br>	
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>	
				}<br>	
				<br>	
				displayInfo();<br>
				</em>
				<br><br>
				<strong>"In this code, the person object is passed into a with block. This allows you to access the name and age properties as though they were locally defined. What actually happens, though, is that a new variable object is pushed to the front of the execution context's scope chain. This variable object contains all of the properties of the specified object (in this case, person) so that they can be accessed without using dot notation. Figure 7.4, "Scope chain augmentation using the with statement" shows how the scope chain for displayInfo is augmented while the with statement is being executed." (archive.oreilly.com)</strong></p>
				<br><br>
				<p>Think I have made sense of it now, especially after seeing the diagram and this other explanation I've found (from the same author).</p>

				<h2>No Block-Level Scopes</h2>
				<p>As I clarified earlier, variables can't be scoped to blocks of code, other than functions. Variables defined within curly braces aren't necessarily destroyed after the code within the curly braces has executed. For example, if a variable is declared within an <em>if</em> statement, that variable is added to the global context, and is accessible after the conditional statement has run. In the case of a <em>for</em> loop, the induction variable (<em>var i</em>) actually becomes a global variable that is accessible after the loop has executed. The presenter in <a href="https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Scope/604268/619464-4.html?org=torontopubliclibrary.ca">this video</a> suggests omitting <em>var</em> from the induction variable of the <em>for</em> statement, and instead, declaring <em>i</em> at the top of your javascript file with the other global variables, since it is going to be a global variable anyways.</p>
				<h4>Code</h4>
				<code>
					if (1 < 2) {<br>
						var j = "jay";<br>
					}<br>
					<br>
			        alert(j);<br>
			        <br>
			        for (var i =0;i < 2; i++) {<br>
			        console.log(i);<br>
			    	}<br>
			    	alert(i);
					&lt;/script&gt;<br>
				</code>

				<h4>Working Example:</h4>
				<script type="text/javascript">
					
					if (1 < 2) {
						var j = "jay";
					}
					
			        
			        for (i =0;i < 2; i++) {
			        console.log(i);
			    	}
			        
				</script>

				<a href="#" onClick="event.preventDefault();alert(j);">Click here to see what value <em>j</em> has.</a><br>
				<a href="#" onClick="event.preventDefault();alert(i);">Click here to see what value <em>i</em> has.</a><br><br>

			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				<h2>Variable Declaration</h2>
				<p>Variables declared within a function using <em>var</em> are scoped to that function, but, if you initialize a variable inside a function without using <em>var</em>, that variable has global scope and can be accessed outside the function.</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				<h2>Identifier Lookup</h2>
				<p>The identifier lookup (for a variable name, for example) starts in the current/local context, the moves to the next context in the scope chain. If it finds it in the current context (inside a function, for example), the search stops. But, if it doesn't find it in the function, it continues along the chain to the next context (e.g., the window/global) to look for it there.</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				<h2>Garbage Collection</h2>
				<p>Javascript is a garbage-collected language, so it automatically marks variables for deletion once they go out of scope. The next time the garbage collector runs, those variables are deleted, and the memory they used is freed up again. This is referred to as <em>mark and sweep</em> garbage collection.</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				<h2>Managing Memory</h2>
				<p>Typically, you don't have to worry about memory management in Javascript, since it is a garbage-collected programming environment. But, because the amount of memory available to the browser is much less than other desktop applications, it can be useful to make sure that make sure that any <strong>global</strong> objects that you don't need anymore are set to <em>null</em> so that they will be garbage-collected. Below is an example of an object (created from a factory function), which is <em>derferenced</em> once it is no longer needed, it order to put it "out of context", so it will be marked for deletion next time garbage-collection occurs.</p><br>
				<code>
					&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br>
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function createPerson(name) {<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var localPerson = new Object();<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;localPerson.name = name;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return localPerson; <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var globalPerson = createPerson("Riley");<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Do something with globalPerson<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;globalPerson = null;
					<br><br>
					&lt;/script&gt;<br>
				</code>
