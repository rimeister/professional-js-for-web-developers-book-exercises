### What is this repository for? ###

This repo contains the exercises I've worked through from the book Professional Javascript for Web Developers (N. Zakas, 3rd edition).

I have included the original exercise files downloaded from the publisher's website. Completion of each exercise happens in the folder for its chapter. For each chapter, I have moved the sample code into a subfolder called `_final`.

Please note, chapters 1 and 2 did not have any sample code, hence why they aren't in the repo.
