					<h2>Understanding Objects</h2>
					<p>ECMA-262 defines an object as an "unordered collection of properties, each of which contains a primitive value, object or function" (p. 173). Each "property" in this case is identified by a "name that is mapped to a value." Objects are based on reference types (native types, or developer-defined). A "reference type", as far as I can tell, is the same as a "class," the author just doesn't want to use the word class, because ECMAScript (prior to ES6) doesn't have proper classes: "Although reference types are similar to classes, the two concepts are not equivelant. To avoid confusion, term class is not used in the rest of this book" (p. 104).</p>
					<p>As the instructor in the Lynda programming Fundamentals class discussed, a <em>class</em> is a "blueprint" for an object. An object is the thing created from the blueprint. "Reference type" refers to what type of object it is (what blueprint it was created from), or, what class of object it is.</p>
					<p>Below is an example of an object I made up, though I guess it would only be an instance of the "Object" class, since I haven't defined a custom class/reference type.</p>
					<br>
					<pre>
					<code class="language-js">
						// Created with Object Literal notation 
						var myObject = { 
							prop1: "Boss", 
							prop2: "Totes", 
							meth1: function() { 
								alert(this.prop1); 
							}, 
							meth2: function(arg1){ 
								alert("The number of characters in this variable is " + arg1.length); 
							} 
						} 
						
						// Create a new instance of object 
						var myObject2 = new Object(); 
						
						myObject2.prop1 = "Boat"; 
						myObject2.prop2 = "Toss"; 
						myObject2.meth1 = function() { 
							alert(this.prop1); 
						}; 
						myObject2.meth2 = function(arg1){ 
							alert("The number of characters in this variable is " + arg1.length); 
						};

					<h2>Types of Properties</h2>
					<p>There are two types of properties: <em>data properties</em> and <em>accessor</em> properties.</p>
					<h3>Data Properties</h3>
					<p>Data Properties have a single location for the data value. This location gets updated when the value changes. <strong>A data property has four attributes</strong> describing it's behaviour: [[Configurable]], [[Enumerable]], [[Writable]], and [[Value]]:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>[[Configurable]]</strong>: Indicates if the property can be deleted, have its properties changed, or can be changed into an accessor property. By default, this is true for all properties defined directly on an object (as in the last example).</li>
						<li><strong>[[Enumerable]]</strong>: Indicates if the property will be returned in a for-in loop. By default, this is true.</li>
						<li><strong>[Writable]]</strong>: Indicates if a property's value can be change. True, by default.</li>
						<li><strong>[[Value]]</strong>: Contains the actual data value for the property.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>When a property is explicitly added to an object as in the previous examples, [[Configurable]], [[Enumerable]], and [[Writable]] are all set to true, while the [[Value]] is set to the assigned value."</p>
					<p>Default property attributes are changed using the ES5 <em>Object.defineProperty()</em> method. This method accepts three arguments: the property to be added or modified, the name of the property, and the descriptor object.</p>
					<h3>Accessor Properties</h3>
					<p>As mentioned above, there are two types of properties that an object has. The first type, discussed above, are <em>data properties</em>. The second type are called <em>Accessor Properties</em>. Accessor Properties do not contain data. Instead, they contain a <em>getter function</em> and/or a <em>setter function</em>. "When an accessor property is read from, the getter function is called, and it's the function's responsibility to return a valid value; when an accessor property is written to, a function is called with the new value, and that function must decide how to react to the data" (p. 177). "It's not possible to define an accessor property explicitly; you must use <em>Object.defineProperty();</em>" (p. 177). The underscore before the property name is a common notation that indicates that the property is not meant to be accessed outside of the object's methods.</p>
					<p>12/20/17 &ndash; I've been trying to understand "accessor properties", and what they're used for. I found a good article, and I've read most of it: <a href="https://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2013/12/es5-getters-setters/">https://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2013/12/es5-getters-setters/</a>. I think I'm getting a handle on accessor properties now (i.e., properties with <em>getter</em> and <em>setter</em> functions). Basically, when the property's value is calculated using a function, instead of being a simple piece of static data. Additionally, when a value for an accessor property is set using the <em>set()</em> attribute, it can update the value of other properties. For instance, the article gives the example of having an accessor property called <em>fullName</em>, which is a combination of the person's first name and last name. "For the most part, in JavaScript, what you see is what you get. A value’s a value; there are no tricks. Sometimes however, you want a value that’s based on some other values: someone’s full name, for example, is a concatenation of their first and last names." When you <em>get()</em> the full name, it returns the first name plus the last name. When you <em>set()</em> the full name, it splits it into the first name and last name, and updates the firstName and lastName properties.</p>
					<p>The author of the article also cautions against overuse: "Remember: just because a feature exists, it doesn’t need to be used all the time. Getters and Setters have their use cases, but don’t go over the top, or you’ll most likely end up with a design that’s confusing for those interacting with your objects."</p>
					<br>
					<p>Accessor properties have four attributes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>[[Configurable]]</strong>: Indicates if the property can be deleted, have its properties changed, or can be changed into an accessor property. By default, this is true for all properties defined directly on an object (as in the last example).</li>
						<li><strong>[[Enumerable]]</strong>: Indicates if the property will be returned in a for-in loop. By default, this is true.</li>
						<li><strong>[[Get]]</strong>: The function to call when the property is read from.</li>
						<li><strong>[[Set]]</strong>: The function to call when the property is written to.</li>
					</ul><br>
					<pre>
					<code class="language-js">
						// data property example

						function updateObjectProps() {
							
							Object.defineProperty(myObject, "prop1", {

							});
						
							d = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(myObject,"prop1");
						
							alert("The value of prop1 is now: " + myObject.prop1 + ". Is it writeable now? " + d.writable);

						}

				<h2>Object Creation</h2>
				<p>This section describes the different patterns used to create objects.</p>
				<h3>The Factory Pattern</h3>
				<p>Consists of a function that returns an object.</p>
				<br>
				<pre>
				<code class="language-js">
					function createPerson(name, age, job){ 
				        	// Create new object
				            var o = new Object(); 
				        	// Define its properties
				            o.name = name; 
				            o.age = age; 
				            o.job = job; 
				            // Give it a method
				            o.sayName = function(){ 
				                alert(this.name); 
				            };     
				        	// Give it a method
				            return o; 
				        }
				         
				        var person1 = createPerson("Nicholas", 29, "Software  Engineer"); 
				        var person2 = createPerson("Greg", 27, "Doctor"); 
				         
				        person1.sayName();   //"Nicholas" 
				        person2.sayName();   //"Greg"			 		
				</code>
				</pre><br><br>
				<h3>The Constructor Pattern</h3>
				<p>Constructors create specific types of objects. Instances are create using the <em>new</em> operator. Note: there is no object being explicitly created in the function, and properties and methods are assigned directly onto the <em>this</em> object. There is no <em>return</em> statement. Constructor functions, by convention, use an uppercase letter for the first letter of the function name.</p>
				<p>The trouble with this pattern is that each time the constructor is called, a new copy of the methods in the constructor is stored in memory. So, the instances don't share a reference to the same method(s), they each reference a different instance of the method (they don't reference the same instance of <em>Function</em>). This clutters up the memory, I think. The author says that it doesn't make sense to have two instances of a function that do the same thing.</p>
				<br>
				<pre>
				<code class="language-js">
			        function Person(name, age, job){
			            this.name = name;
			            this.age = age;
			            this.job = job;
			            this.sayName = function(){
			                alert(this.name);
			            };    
			        }
			        
			        var person1 = new Person("Nicholas", 29, "Software Engineer");
			        var person2 = new Person("Greg", 27, "Doctor");
			        
			        person1.sayName();   //"Nicholas"
			        person2.sayName();   //"Greg"
			        
			        alert(person1 instanceof Object);  //true
			        alert(person1 instanceof Person);  //true
			        alert(person2 instanceof Object);  //true
			        alert(person2 instanceof Person);  //true
			        
			        alert(person1.constructor == Person);  //true
			        alert(person2.constructor == Person);  //true
			        
			        alert(person1.sayName == person2.sayName);  //false

				<h3>The Prototype Pattern</h3>
				<p>Each <strong>function</strong> is created with a prototype property. The "prototype" is an "object containing properties and methods that should be available to instances of a particular reference type" (p. 184). The prototype is a blueprint for the object to be created once the <strong>constructor</strong> (as discussed in the <em>constructor</em> method) is called. The benefit of using the prototype is that the properties and method are all shared amongst the instances of that reference type.</p>
				<p>In the constrcutor method, the properties and method information are added in the constructor function. With the prototype pattern, the methods and properties are added to the prototype, outside of the constructor function, as seen below.</p>

				<p><strike>My understanding is that, since the prototype is shared amongst the instances, changing the value of a property (or method) on the prototype would change it on all instances.</strike> I'll give that a try below.</p>
				<p><strong>Result:</strong> Huh, looks like that is not true. They both keep their own names.</p>
				<p><strong>Further results: Updating the property value on the prototype updates the value of that property on all instances of that reference type</strong>. This is discussed on pg: 194: "Changes made to the prototype at any point are immediately reflected on instances, even instances that existed before the change was made."</p>

				<p>"When you add a property to an instance that has the same name as a property on the prototype, you create the property on the instance, which then masks the property on the prototype." So, when you call the property on the instance (e.g., person3.name), it searches the instance and finds the property, and does not continue searching up the chain to prototype. If you want to remove the property from the instance altogether, you can do so with the <em>delete</em> operator.</p>

				<p>According to page 197, the real problem with prototypes occurs "when a property contains a reference value." The problem results from the shared nature of prototypes: Updating a reference value on one instance updates is on all instances.</p>
				<br>
				<pre>
<code class="language-js">
function Person() {
	// Notice that this constructor function is empty.
}

Person.prototype.name = "Nicholas";
Person.prototype.age = 29;
Person.prototype.job = "Software Engineer";
Person.prototype.sayName = function(){
	alert(this.name);
}

// Create a new instance of Person
var person3 = new Person();

var person4 = new Person();

// See if the function added to the prototype worked
person3.sayName();

person4.name = 'Johnny';

</code>
				</pre><br><br>
				<script type="text/javascript">
					function Person() {
						// Notice that this constructor function is empty.
					}

					Person.prototype.name = "Nicholas";
					Person.prototype.age = 29;
					Person.prototype.job = "Software Engineer";
					Person.prototype.sayName = function(){
						alert(this.name);
					}

					// Create a new instance of Person
					var person3 = new Person();

					var person4 = new Person();

				</script>
				<a href="#" onClick="event.preventDefault();person3.sayName();">See the value of "name" on the person3 instance</a>.<br>
				<a href="#" onClick="event.preventDefault();person4.name='Johnny';">Change the value of "name" on the person4 instance</a>. Check person3 again, see if they're the same.<br>
				<a href="#" onClick="event.preventDefault();person4.sayName();">See the value of "name" on the person4 instance</a>. // Result: The value of person3 and person4's <em>name</em> property appear to be unrelated.<br>
				<a href="#" onClick="event.preventDefault();Person.prototype.name='BossNelson';">Change the value of "name" on the Person prototype</a>. Check person3 again, see if they're the same.<br> // Updating the property value on the prototype updates the value of that property on all instances of that reference type
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				<h2>Alternate Prototype Syntax</h2>
				<p>To limit redundancy and visually encapsulate the functionality being added to the prototype, you can assign the properties and methods to the prototype using an object literal. This has become the common way of doing it. <strong>But there is one difference:</strong> the constructor property on the prototype no longer points to <em>Boss</em>. This is because we have blown away the old prototype object and replaced it with this new one, instead of just adding to it, as we did in the last example. <em>constructor</em> is the only created automatically on the prototype, and points back to the constructor function that created it. From page 185: "When defining a custom constructor, the prototype gets the <em>constructor</em> property only by default; all other methods are inherited from <em>Object</em>." Apparently, the <em>instanceof</em> operator still works reliably, but you can't rely on the <em>constructor</em> property to tell you which constructor the prototype belongs to. You can assign it back in, if you want, though, as in the example below.</p>
				<br>
<pre>
<code class="language-js">

function Boss() {
}

Boss.prototype = {
	constructor: Boss,
	name: "Doodler",
	age: 29,
	job: "Software Engineer",
	sayName: function() {
		alert(this.name);
	}
}

var boss1 = new Boss();
</code></pre><br><br>
				<script type="text/javascript">
					// JS here
					function Boss() {
					}
					Boss.prototype = {
						name: "Doodler",
						age: 29,
						job: "Software Engineer",
						sayName: function() {
							alert(this.name);
						}
					}

					var boss1 = new Boss();

				</script>
				<a href="#" onClick="event.preventDefault();boss1.sayName();">Click to see value of name on boss1</a>.<br>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				<h2>Combination Constructor/Prototype Pattern</h2>
				<p>The author says that this is the most common way to define custom reference types. The constructor defines instance properties, and the prototype defines the methods and shared properties. "With this approach, each instance ends up with its own copy of the instance properties, but they all share reference to methods, conserving memory. This pattern allows arguments to be passed into the constructor as well, effectively combining the best parts of each pattern."</p>
